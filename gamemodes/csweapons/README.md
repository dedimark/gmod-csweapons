Counter-Strike: Source-esque weapons for Garry's Mod.

This addon tries to faithfully recreate the counter strike source weapons we all love ( and hate ) , while still providing a weapon base that can be used for custom counter strike weapons.

The code we use to replicate these weapons is really outdated, so it doesn't contain the latest balance changes and recoils/spread patterns from the current CS:S.

If you need to submit a pull request, please don't use garry's style of coding ( using unnecessary brackets in ifs, adding ; everywhere, ! && || instead of not and or), it's incredibly annoying to read and we don't care if garry , acecool or robotboy want to endorse it.

Most of the code is a straight port from c++, so the naming convention for variables is not exactly consistent ( mostly Jvs' fault )
